# das-hand
Repository for real-time hand model used for prosthesis control, and associated code.

To get the executable (mex) files, download the [latest release](https://github.com/dasproject/das-hand/releases), rather than the source.

Please cite D. Blana et al., "Model-based control of individual finger movements for prosthetic hand function," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering (https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2967901) if you make use of this model for published research.
